# React Form

This project is a React-based web application designed to demonstrate form handling, context management, and navigation within a React application. It utilizes React Router for navigation and Context API for state management across components.

## Project Structure

- `src`: The source directory contains all the React components, assets, contexts, layouts, models, and styles.
  - `App.tsx`: The main application component.
  - `main.tsx`: The entry point for the React application.
  - `index.css`: Global styles for the application.
  - `assets`: Directory containing images and other static resources.
  - `components`: Reusable React components like buttons, input groups, and headers.
  - `context`: React context providers for global state management.
  - `layout/pages`: Contains page components for the application.
  - `models`: TypeScript models and interfaces used across the application.
- `public`: Contains the static assets like images that are publicly accessible.
- `package.json`: Defines project dependencies and scripts.

## Features

- **Form Handling**: Demonstrates a dynamic form handling mechanism using React state and context.
- **Context API**: Utilizes React's Context API for state management across different components.
- **Navigation**: Implements navigation using React Router.
